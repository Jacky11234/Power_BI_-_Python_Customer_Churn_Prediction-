[Python Customer Churn Prediction](https://jacky2-7331dc6bc45d.herokuapp.com/)

# Customer Churn Analysis and Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer churn for Coast-Tel, a telecommunications provider. Using Power BI and Python, we performed an in-depth analysis of customer demographics, service usage, and payment methods. We also applied machine learning techniques, including clustering analysis and churn prediction models, to identify high-risk customers and provide targeted retention strategies. The insights gained from this project aim to enhance customer retention and drive sales growth by understanding key factors influencing churn and implementing effective marketing strategies.

## Key Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of customer attributes
- Visualization of churn distribution across different features
- Machine Learning-based clustering of customers
- Prediction model for customer churn probability

Feel free to explore the code and visualizations provided in this repository.
